# Acode Cloud (Cloud Backup) 

Acode Cloud is an Acode Plugin that enables you to securely back up selected files (and folders) to the cloud.
Futures releases would enable you backup your Acode plugins locally or to the cloud as well. This feature will be restricted to "Acode Cloud Pro."
## Update:
Fixed https error and upgraded storage server. Minor bugs fixed as well. 

> Please note that Acode Cloud is currently designed for text/code files. Future updates will see full support for other kinds of files.  

### Is signing up required

4. Click "Get Started."

You might need to restart Acode after installing this plug-in. 

A unique token (Acode Cloud Token) will be generated and shown to you only once. Ensure you copy and save/write it down somewhere. You'll need your Acode Cloud Token to reaccess your backed-up files just the way you left them in case of data loss, Acode or Acode Cloud reinstallation, etc.
Future releases will support plugins backup and restoration from Cloud as well.
